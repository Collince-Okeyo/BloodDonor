# BloodDonor

BloodDonor is an Android project motivated by the crisis in the low Blood Bank. This is a project approved by the Kibabii University panels to be presented as my final year project. 

The main aim to build this app is to learn the following topic:
- Dependency injection with Dagger-Hilt
- MVVM architecture
- Room database
- Firebase Realtime database
- Google Maps

# Libraries
- [Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/kotlin) - Kotlin is a programming language that can run on JVM. Google has announced Kotlin as one of its officially supported programming languages in Android Studio; and the Android community is migrating at a pace from Java to Kotlin
- [Navigation Components](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started) -  Helps you implement navigation, from simple button clicks to more complex patterns, such as app bars and the navigation drawer.
- [Viewmodel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) -The ViewModel class is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way
- [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) -  A lifecycle-aware data holder with the observer pattern
- [Kotlin Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) - A concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously
- [Hilt-Dagger](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) - Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in your project. Doing manual dependency injection requires you to construct every class and its dependencies by hand, and to use containers to reuse and manage dependencies.
- [MVVM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mvvm-model-view-viewmodel-architecture-pattern-in-android/) - MVVM stands for Model, View, ViewModel. Model: This holds the data of the application. It cannot directly talk to the View. Generally, it's recommended to expose the data to the ViewModel through Observables.
- [Room Persistance library](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room) - The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - Is a platform developed by Google for creating mobile and web applications.
- [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/start) - Is an Android SDK for adding maps to and Android application.
